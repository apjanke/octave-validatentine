Validatinator for GNU Octave
============================

Validation functions for GNU Octave.

In Matlab R2017a, Matlab introduced [Validation Functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/property-validator-functions.html) that allow you concisely express requirements for the types and values of variable and property values.
Octave doesnâ€™t have those yet.
This project provides implementations of them, both some Matlab-compatible ones, and some Octave-specific extensions.
